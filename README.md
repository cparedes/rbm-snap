This is based off of the tutorial here:

I'm trying my hand at learning Haskell *and* replacing what I have right
now with Octopress.

Motivation
==========

Why redo the site in Haskell?

I figure that learning functional programming is going to only help me out
in the long run, plus Haskell has been getting a lot more traction these days.
I've been wanting to learn a functional language for a while, and I think
Haskell would be a great way to go head first into it.
